# paralelImageFilter
 programs written using MPI parallel programming technologies to filter images using median image filter 
The project aims to demonstrate the difference in computational time between normal and parallel programming.

you can convert any image into array form and apply the filter then you can convert the image back into the desired form using the script script.sh
